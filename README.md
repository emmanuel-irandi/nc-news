# NC News site. 

A website containing articles from my backend API, you can sort them using sort options and filter by topic.

Use the navigation menu to select a topic. You will be logged in as a random user from a list of default users,
you can comment on & like posts, as well as delete comments that belong to you. 

You need v20.18.0 of node.js to run my site.

To install my app, run these commands:

``
git clone https://github.com/emmanuel-irandi/nc-news
``

``
cd nc-news
``

``
npm run dev
``
